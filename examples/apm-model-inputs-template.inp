; Comments are denoted by a preceeding ';' and are ignored by the file reader.
; All input and output paths need to be absolute or defined relative to the location
; the executable is being run from.
; One or more consectuative spaces are treated as delimiters except when the value is
; enclosed inside a set a double quotation marks, otherwise quotations are not required.
; Output file locations are not required and by default are created with a generic name
; in the current working directory.
; If an output file is specified, any preceeding directories must already exist.
; Recommended extensions have been shown on output files below.
; When populating fields be sure to remove the parentheses and semicolons for the input
; to be used by the model.
; Units are requried where appropriate and must be separated from the  value by at
; least one space.
